# Town Builder
This is a procedural modelling tool for SideFX Houdini. The project is inspired by the city-building game Townscaper. Simply click on the grid to create a 3D town model.

The project is created in Houdini Apprentice 18 (a free version). To use the project, make sure there is Houdini installed on the device.

After getting into the 'geo1' node, click on 'Show Handle' on the left-hand side of the viewport and have the 'Town_Builder' node in the network editor selected, the build tool will be activated.

Now, the grid is responding to the interaction. Use the left mouse button to click (or click and drag) on the grid to make a building(s). And undo a single extrude at a time by holding the CTRL key while clicking (with a slight drag) on the polygon. To clear all builds on the grid, click on the 'Reset' key at the top of the viewport.
